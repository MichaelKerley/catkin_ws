# catkin_ws (Drone BRANCH)

Please follow along carefully
If you do not do exactly as the instructions indicate then YOU WILL have issues
I have done lots of work getting everything into a nice easy to use git repo so in theory all the issues I ran into should be avoided

1: Clone the repo

'git clone https://github.com/MichaelKerley/catkin_ws.git'
